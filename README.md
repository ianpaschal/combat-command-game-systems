## Usage

### Example: Working with Flames of War Data

```typescript
import {
  Faction,
  getFactionDisplayName,
  getFactionOptions,
} from '@ianpaschal/combat-command-game-systems/flamesOfWarV4';

// Get all faction options
const factionOptions = getFactionOptions();
console.log(factionOptions); // Array of select items ({value: Faction; displayName: string;})

// Get a specific faction's display name
const displayName = getFactionDisplayName(Faction.GreatBritain);
console.log(displayName); // "Great Britain"
```

### Example: Working with Common Data

```typescript
import {
  getTournamentPairingMethodOptions,
} from '@ianpaschal/combat-command-game-systems/common';

// Get tournament pairing method options
const pairingMethodOptions = getTournamentPairingMethodOptions();
console.log(pairingMethodOptions);
```

## Architecture

### Project Structure

Game systems are stored according to the following format: `./src/{publisher}/{gameSystem}`.

This folder should be structured similarly to a game system folder.

```
/
├── _internal/    # Internal utilities (createGameSystemUtils)
├── data/         # Shared data types (battle plans, missions, etc.)
├── helpers/      # Utility functions (calculateMatchResultScore(), etc.)
└── schema/       # Zod validation schemas
    ├── gameSystemConfig.ts    # MUST BE PRESENT!
    └── matchResultDetails.ts  # MUST BE PRESENT!
```

Within each publisher folder, there can also be a `_shared` folder which is structured the same as a game system folder, but contains assets (enums, utility functions, etc.) which are used by multiple game systems from that publisher.
